== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to `/wp-content/plugins/smart-pdf-for-wp-enhanced/`
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure settings in Settings â†’ Smart PDF
4. Upload your logo and customize header/footer text
5. Add custom CSS if needed (with built-in validation)
6. Enable "Auto-Download" for direct PDF downloads

== Custom CSS Guidelines ==

When adding custom CSS for PDFs:
* Use standard CSS properties only (no HTML tags or JavaScript)
* Avoid `position: fixed` and `position: sticky` 
* Use pt, px, or mm units for better PDF rendering
* Target these classes: `.spdf-container`, `.spdf-header`, `.spdf-content`, `.spdf-footer`, `.spdf-title`
* The plugin validates your CSS in real-time

**Example Custom CSS:**
```css
body { font-family: Georgia, serif; }
.spdf-title { color: #2c3e50; font-size: 24pt; }
.spdf-content p { text-align: justify; }
.spdf-header { border-bottom: 3px solid #3498db; }
```

== Shortcode ==

`[spdf]` - Renders the download button for the current post
`[spdf id="123"]` - Renders a button for a specific post ID

== Configuration ==

The enhanced version includes these settings:

* **Logo Upload**: Visual logo picker with media library integration  
* **Auto-Download**: Force PDF download instead of browser preview
